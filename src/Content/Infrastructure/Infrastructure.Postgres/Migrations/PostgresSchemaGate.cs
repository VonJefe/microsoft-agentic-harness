/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Migrations run lazily on first use rather than at dependency-injection composition or from a
/// hosted service. The harness has several hosts — console, agent hub, execution API, MCP server —
/// and only some of them run hosted services; binding schema readiness to first use is the one point
/// that is guaranteed to happen in all of them, and it happens before the first query rather than
/// racing it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A failed attempt does not latch. Postgres being briefly unreachable while the host starts is
/// ordinary, and a store that gave up permanently on the first refused connection would need a
/// restart to recover from a condition that fixes itself.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// It does, however, cool down for <see cref="FailureCooldown"/>. Not latching is right for a
/// transient fault and wrong for a permanent one, and the runner now has a permanent one it can
/// report: a migration whose checksum no longer matches what this database applied will fail every
/// time until a human intervenes. Without a cooldown that failure is re-attempted on every physical
/// connection for the life of the process, each attempt taking the cluster-wide advisory lock to be
/// told the same thing. The cooldown keeps the recovery property — the next request after the window
/// tries again — while making a hopeless failure cheap.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Where to call it from.</strong> There are two shapes in this repo and the choice is not
/// arbitrary, so a third Postgres-backed store should copy the one that matches its own structure
/// rather than whichever it read first.

/// <item>
/// <description>
/// <em>A store with one place it opens connections</em> — <c>PostgreSqlGraphStore</c> — calls
/// <see cref="EnsureAsync"/> there. Simplest, and the preferred shape when the seam exists.
/// </description>
/// </item>
/// <item>
/// <description>
/// <em>A store with no such seam</em> — <c>PostgresObservabilityStore</c>, where eighteen call sites
/// take commands straight off an <c>NpgsqlDataSource</c> — hooks
/// <c>NpgsqlDataSourceBuilder.UsePhysicalConnectionInitializer</c> instead. That reaches every one of
/// them without threading a call through all eighteen, and it runs before the first query rather
/// than racing it. Note that it needs both the sync and async initializer; the sync one should throw,
/// because a synchronous <c>Open()</c> would skip the migration entirely.

/// </list>
/// <para>
/// A factory to unify the two was considered and is the wrong shape: what differs is not how the
/// data source is built but whether the store has a single point at which a connection becomes
/// available, which is a property of the store, not of its configuration.
/// </para>
/// <para>

/// <see cref="SemaphoreSlim"/> — and the ceremony was immediately skipped by one of its two
/// consumers, which is the tell that it was never needed. A <see cref="SemaphoreSlim"/> only needs
/// disposing if its <c>AvailableWaitHandle</c> has been touched, which allocates the underlying
/// handle; nothing here touches it. Exporting a lifetime requirement that does not exist buys
/// nothing and gives every consumer a decision it can get wrong.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A public <c>Dispose</c> survived that removal for a while, on a type that no longer implements
/// the interface — so nothing called it, and nothing could have noticed. Do not put it back. The

/// found the method and called it would leave every subsequent connection unable to open, and the
