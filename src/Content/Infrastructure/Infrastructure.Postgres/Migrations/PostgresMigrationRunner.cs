/// <summary>
/// Applies an ordered set of SQL migrations to a Postgres database, recording what it has applied so
/// that a database which already holds data receives only the changes it is missing.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// This exists because the template previously had no way to change the shape of a database that was
/// already in use. The observability schema was delivered by files mounted at
/// <c>/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d</c>, which Postgres runs exactly once — when it initialises an
/// empty data directory — and never again. A consumer who had been running the harness for a month
/// could not receive a schema change at all, and CI could not see the problem because it built a
/// fresh database on every run.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>The whole run is one transaction.</strong> Postgres applies DDL transactionally, so either
/// every outstanding migration lands or none does. That is a deliberate choice over the more common
/// per-migration transaction: a database left half-upgraded is a state nothing else in this system
/// knows how to reason about, whereas a database left at its previous version is simply the state it
/// was already in, and the throw makes it loud.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Failure is fatal by design.</strong> The observability store swallows and logs write
/// failures so telemetry can never fail the agent turn that produced it. That rule must not extend
/// here: a schema failure that reports success is exactly how the original defect stayed invisible
/// for as long as it did.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>An applied migration is history.</strong> The ledger records a checksum of each script
/// alongside its id, and a script whose text has changed since this database ran it stops the run.
/// Without that, editing a released migration is a no-op here and a full apply on every database
/// created afterwards — the installed base splits in two and nothing says so. See
/// <see cref="MigrationScript.Checksum"/>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Postgres only. SQLite is not migrated by this and should not be.</strong> The EF Core
/// subsystems reconcile their SQLite schema through <c>SchemaInitializer&lt;TContext&gt;</c>, which
/// diffs the live database against the EF model and adds what is missing. The two are different
/// mechanisms for different problems, kept apart on purpose: the reconciler is model-driven and
/// additive-only, which suits a store whose shape is defined by entity classes, while ordered
/// hand-written DDL is the only way to express a constraint being widened or a table rewritten —
/// operations SQLite largely cannot perform in place anyway, and which have no representation in an
/// EF model. Neither is redundant, and extending either to cover the other's job would make it worse
/// at its own.
