/// <summary>
/// The single arming site for enveloped plan runs: initializes the scoped governance identity, publishes
/// the caller's capability envelope ambiently, and drives <see cref="IPlanExecutor"/> inside that scope.
/// Modeled directly on <c>BundleRunExecutor</c> — see <see cref="IPlanRunExecutor"/> for the doctrine.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Ordering that preserves the invariants.</strong> A fresh DI scope is created per run so the
/// scoped <see cref="IAgentExecutionContext"/>, tool-invocation governor, and step executors all share one
/// identity that cannot leak across runs. The execution context is initialized <em>before</em> the envelope
/// is armed: the governor fails closed on any identity-less tool call made under an ambient envelope (by
/// design), so arming the envelope first would open a window where a concurrently scheduled step is denied
/// for the wrong reason. The envelope scope is disposed in a <c>finally</c> (via <c>using</c>) on every
/// path, and the plan summary is fully materialised before disposal — no deferred enumeration outlives the
/// scope.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Fail-closed posture.</strong> This path cannot run un-enveloped: a missing envelope or blank
/// agent identity is rejected with a stable error code before any plan state is touched. Unexpected
/// exceptions are logged in full but surfaced only as <c>plan_run.execution_failed</c> — raw exception
/// text never reaches the caller. That guard spans identity initialization and executor resolution as
/// well as the run itself, so <see cref="IPlanRunExecutor"/>'s unqualified "never raw exception text"
/// holds literally rather than by happening to have no throwing setup.
