/// <para>
/// <strong>Envelope confinement.</strong> The step is authorized as the well-known capability
/// <see cref="PlanCapabilities.LlmCall"/> through <see cref="IToolInvocationGovernor"/>, the same
/// choke point the tool and retrieval steps use. Without it a caller holding the most restrictive
/// possible envelope (no tools, Restricted ceiling) could still drive unbounded model inference on
/// the host's credential with a plan-authored system prompt: tools the resulting agent calls stay
/// confined, so the exposure is spend and prompt surface rather than privilege escalation, but an
/// unmetered path defeats the point of confining the run.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Two identities, deliberately separate — see <see cref="PlanRunKeys"/>.</strong> Each step
/// gets its <em>own</em> conversation id. A conversation id is not just a budget key: it is the sole
/// key of <c>IAgentConversationCache</c>, which returns a cached agent on a hit and ignores the
/// requested skills and options, so sharing one id across steps would make a step run under another
/// step's agent (with <c>MaxParallelSteps</c> defaulting to 10, concurrent steps are the normal case)
/// and would let the first step to finish evict the cache and clear skill tracking for steps still
/// running. Cross-step spend is instead accumulated against a separate run-level budget key.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Each step's conversation runs in its own DI scope.</strong> The conversation is dispatched
/// through an <see cref="ISender"/> resolved from a fresh scope rather than the plan's scope, because
/// <c>IAgentExecutionContext</c> is scoped and single-binding: <c>AgentContextPropagationBehavior</c>
/// calls <c>Initialize</c> for the nested agent-turn request, whose agent id is the step's
/// <em>deployment key</em> and whose conversation id is this step's. The plan's scope is already bound
/// by <c>PlanRunExecutor</c> to the caller's identity and the run's conversation, and re-initializing
/// one context with a different agent or conversation throws by design (it is normally a scope leak).
/// Dispatching in a per-step scope gives every turn a clean context to bind, which is also what makes
/// the per-step cache and skill-tracking isolation real rather than nominal. This mirrors
/// <c>BundleRunExecutor</c>, which resolves its mediator from its own scope for the same reason. The
/// capability envelope is ambient (<c>AsyncLocal</c>) and flows into the child scope unchanged, so
/// confinement is unaffected.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Budget ownership.</strong> <c>RunConversationCommandHandler</c> owns its conversation's
/// budget entry and <c>Release</c>s it in a <c>finally</c>, so an entry under any conversation id is
/// erased when that conversation ends and can never carry spend to the next step. Rather than fight
/// that ownership, the plan run accumulates <see cref="ConversationResult.TotalTokens"/> against its
/// own <see cref="PlanRunKeys.RunBudgetKey"/> after each step and gates the next step on it;
/// <c>PlanRunExecutor</c> releases that key when the run ends. With no run scope (an ad-hoc direct
/// in-process call) there is no run-level budget and behavior is exactly as before.
