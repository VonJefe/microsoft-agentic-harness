/// Issue #258. This replaces roughly 440 lines of hand-rolled, indent-sensitive parsing that had
/// grown two near-identical block readers — one for <c>egress.allowlist</c>, one for <c>tools</c>.
/// Keeping them in step was the problem: a blank-line defect had to be fixed in both, and it was
/// only found in the second because a reviewer went looking. One of the two parses an outbound
/// network allowlist, where silently dropping an entry narrows a security control without saying so.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The comment that justified hand-rolling ("one nested block doesn't warrant a YAML dependency")
/// stopped being true once it was two blocks and 440 lines. YamlDotNet was already a pinned
/// dependency of this solution and already in use by the evaluation dataset loader, so this adds no
/// supply-chain surface. Every SKILL.md this repository ships or vendors — 22 of them, including
/// third-party ones from npm — parses cleanly under a strict YAML reader; that was measured before
/// the change, not assumed.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Unreadable frontmatter REFUSES the skill; it does not load a partial one.</strong> The
/// hand-rolled parser degraded per field, so a typo cost one field. A strict reader cannot do
/// that — one bad line fails the whole document — and degrading to an empty document would have
/// silently emptied <c>allowed-tools</c> and <c>egress</c> along with it. An empty allowlist is
/// not "no opinion": it means this skill contributes no tool ceiling, and a null egress manifest
/// means "inherit the global default". A typo would therefore have quietly widened the security
/// posture behind a warning nobody reads.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// So <see cref="Load"/> throws instead, and both callers — <c>SkillMetadataRegistry</c> and
/// <c>NestedSkillScanner</c> — already catch per manifest and continue. The result is that one
/// unreadable skill is skipped and logged while every other skill still loads: loud, contained,
/// and never half-configured. The inputs this matters for are ordinary typos, not exotica: an
/// unquoted colon in a description, a tab used for indentation, or a duplicate key.
