/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Why this replaces the file-backed store as the default.</strong>
/// <see cref="FileSystemConversationStore"/> appends by reading a whole JSON record, adding one
/// message, and rewriting the file through a shared temporary path. That is safe only while a
/// single process does it: two processes can interleave bytes into the same staging file and move a
/// torn record into place, and two concurrent appends can lose one of the messages outright. Here
/// the corruption and lost-update paths do not exist to be mitigated — a message row is inserted and
/// nothing rereads-and-rewrites the transcript. SQLite serialises writers across processes on one
/// machine through its own file locking, which is the same guarantee the planner's durable state
/// already relies on. It does not extend across machines; a horizontally scaled deployment needs a
/// server-backed implementation behind <see cref="IConversationStore"/>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Header mutations are direct <c>UPDATE</c> statements.</strong> Every method that changes
/// the conversation row uses <c>ExecuteUpdateAsync</c> rather than loading, mutating, and saving an
/// entity. That keeps each mutation a single statement touching only the columns it owns, so two
/// callers writing different columns cannot overwrite each other with stale values — the failure a
/// read-modify-write invites. The row count the statement returns doubles as the existence check.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Ownership is part of the statement, not a step before it.</strong> Every mutation carries
/// <c>UserId == callerId</c> in its <c>WHERE</c> clause, so the check and the write are one atomic
/// operation against the database. Checking first and writing second — what each caller used to do —
/// leaves a window in which the row can change between the two, and it costs an extra round trip on
/// the success path. Here the cost is inverted: nothing extra is read unless the statement matched
/// no rows, and only then is a probe issued to tell "no such conversation" apart from "not yours".
