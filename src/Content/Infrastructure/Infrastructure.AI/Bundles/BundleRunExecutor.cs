/// <summary>
/// The shared engine that drives a single bundle run to a terminal state under its capability envelope and
/// ephemeral-agent overlay. Both triggers of a bundle run call it: the <see cref="BundleRunBackgroundService"/>
/// (async, poll-only runs) and the streaming endpoint (opt-in live runs). Concentrating the security-critical
/// ambient arming here is what stops the two triggers from diverging — see <see cref="IBundleRunExecutor"/>.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Ordering that preserves the invariants.</strong> The lease on the staged bundle is acquired
/// <em>before</em> the run is claimed <see cref="BundleRunStatus.Running"/>: a run whose handle expired before
/// it could start is failed straight from <see cref="BundleRunStatus.Queued"/> so it never carries a bogus
/// start time, and the lease then pins the staging directory against the cleanup sweeper for the whole run so
/// the ephemeral agent can read its skills from disk. The claim itself is an atomic
/// <see cref="IBundleRunJobStore.TryBeginRun"/> compare-and-set, so if two drivers race for the same job (two
/// stream connections, or a stream and the dispatcher) exactly one wins and drives it; the loser releases its
/// lease and reports <see cref="BundleRunExecutionStatus.AlreadyClaimed"/>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Ambients.</strong> The capability envelope and overlay are re-published for the duration of the
/// drive; the envelope's presence is what makes the tool-invocation governor enforce, so omitting it would
/// fail the gate open. The scope wraps the whole <see cref="RunConversationCommand"/>, which returns a fully
/// materialised result — assistant text is streamed out-of-band through the ambient turn-stream sink while the
/// command runs, so there is no deferred enumeration outliving the scope.
