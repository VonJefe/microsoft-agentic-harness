/// <summary>
/// EF Core row for one durably persisted <c>ChangeProposal</c> in the governance-state store.
/// The aggregate itself is stored as a JSON document (its diff, history, and polymorphic
/// target don't map usefully to columns); the dimensions
/// <c>IChangeProposalStore.ListAsync</c> filters or orders on are denormalized into
/// first-class, indexed columns and kept in sync on every save.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Configured inline in <see cref="Infrastructure.AI.Persistence.GovernanceStateDbContext"/>,
/// matching the other contexts here. This used to be forced:
/// <see cref="Infrastructure.AI.Persistence.PlannerDbContext"/> scanned the whole assembly and
/// would have applied an <c>IEntityTypeConfiguration</c> for this entity to its own model. The
/// planner now declares its five configurations explicitly, so inline is a convention rather than
/// a constraint. No <c>Version</c> column: <c>SaveAsync</c> is contractually last-write-wins
/// on the proposal id, so the planner's <c>SqliteVersionInterceptor</c> scheme is not applied.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <see cref="SubmittedAtTicks"/> is a raw UTC-tick <see cref="long"/>, diverging from the
/// <c>SqliteValueConverters.DateTimeOffsetAsUtcTicks</c> converter that
/// <c>PromptUsageDbContext</c> and <c>EvalDashboardDbContext</c> use for their timestamps. The
/// reason is schema consistency with <see cref="EscalationStateEntity"/> in the same database and
/// the same store pair, NOT a materialization hazard of its own: this column is only ever written,
/// ordered by, and range-filtered server-side — <c>ListAsync</c> does not project it, and the
/// aggregate's <c>SubmittedAt</c> is read from <see cref="ProposalJson"/> — so a converter here
/// would have nothing to throw on during a list query. See <see cref="EscalationStateEntity"/> for
/// the column where the hazard is real and load-bearing.
