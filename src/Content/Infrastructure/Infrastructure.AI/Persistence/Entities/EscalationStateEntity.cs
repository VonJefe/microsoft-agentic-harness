/// <summary>
/// EF Core row for one durably persisted escalation in the governance-state store.
/// The full request / decisions / outcome payloads are JSON documents (the domain records
/// are rich, nested, and versioned by shape); the columns EF filters or orders on
/// (status, timestamps) are first-class and indexed.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Configured inline in <see cref="Infrastructure.AI.Persistence.GovernanceStateDbContext"/>,
/// matching the other contexts here. This used to be forced:
/// <see cref="Infrastructure.AI.Persistence.PlannerDbContext"/> scanned the whole assembly and
/// would have applied an <c>IEntityTypeConfiguration</c> for this entity to its own model. The
/// planner now declares its five configurations explicitly, so inline is a convention rather than
/// a constraint. No <c>Version</c> column: rows are single-writer per escalation (the
/// singleton escalation service serializes writes per record), so the planner's
/// <c>SqliteVersionInterceptor</c> concurrency scheme is not applied to this context.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Timestamps are stored as raw UTC-tick <see cref="long"/> columns and converted inside the
/// store's guarded per-row mapping, rather than by the <c>SqliteValueConverters</c>
/// <c>DateTimeOffsetAsUtcTicks</c> converter that <c>PromptUsageDbContext</c> and
/// <c>EvalDashboardDbContext</c> apply to their timestamps. A converter's conversion is compiled
/// into EF's query shaper, so it runs during materialization — outside the per-row guard — and
/// <c>new DateTimeOffset(ticks, TimeSpan.Zero)</c> throws for an out-of-range tick. Deferring it
/// keeps one corrupt row quarantinable instead of failing the scan that reads past it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The divergence from those two sibling contexts is deliberate and rests on a difference in
/// requirements, not taste: they serve dashboard queries pulled on demand, where failing the query
/// is an acceptable answer, whereas <see cref="CreatedAtTicks"/> is read by the startup
/// rehydration scan that restores pending human approvals. Losing that whole scan to one bad row
/// would strand every pending approval. Note the guarantee is partial by necessity —
/// <see cref="Id"/> is a Guid BLOB that EF must convert during materialization regardless — which
/// is why <c>EscalationStateRehydrationService</c> additionally treats a scan-level failure as
/// non-fatal (LogCritical and continue to boot) rather than letting it stop the host.
