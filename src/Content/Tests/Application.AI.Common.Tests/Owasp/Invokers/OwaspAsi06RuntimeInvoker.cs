/// <summary>
/// ASI06 Memory Poisoning fixture invoker that drives the <em>real</em> memory quarantine runtime —
/// the write gate (<see cref="ProvenanceMemoryWriteGate"/>) and trust-aware recall
/// (<see cref="KnowledgeMemoryService"/>) — rather than returning a hardcoded payload.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Scenario: an attacker plants a prompt-injection payload that reaches the unattended memory-write
/// path. The deterministic prompt-injection scanner (the one external boundary, stubbed here exactly
/// as it is in the gate's own unit tests) flags it at <see cref="ThreatLevel.High"/> — within the
/// quarantine band. Everything else is the production runtime: the gate classifies the fact
/// <see cref="MemoryTrust.Untrusted"/> and persists it; recall must then withhold it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The emitted payload is read back from the live in-memory store and the real
/// <see cref="KnowledgeMemoryService.RecallAsync"/> call, so the metric scores observed runtime
/// behavior: the poisoned node exists (retained for forensics), is marked <c>untrusted</c>, and is
/// returned zero times by recall.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Both memory channels are exercised, and that is the point (issue #338).</strong> The
/// harness has two paths that persist model-derived text and replay it into an agent's instructions:
/// knowledge memory and learnings. This fixture originally drove only the first, which is how the
/// second stayed ungated behind a passing ASI06 score for as long as it did. The same attack payload
/// is now written through <see cref="RememberCommandHandler"/> as well, and the payload reports the
/// same three facts for that channel — so an eval that passes means both are closed.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// This is the one OWASP fixture that drives real infrastructure rather than a deterministic stub.
/// It is justified — and unique — because the ASI06 memory-quarantine defense is pure, deterministic
/// runtime logic with no LLM in the loop, so it can be exercised faithfully in-process. The other
/// nine fixtures depend on the full agent turn (and an LLM), which is why they stay stubbed. A
/// merge-blocking security gate that scored a hardcoded payload would be theater; this case scores
/// the real defense, and so will fail if a future change regresses the quarantine contract — which
/// is the gate doing its job. Unit-level coverage of the same control also lives in
/// <c>Infrastructure.AI.KnowledgeGraph.Tests</c>; the duplication is intentional (the OWASP fixture
/// is a catalogued compliance demonstration, not just coverage).
