/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Why the real chain.</strong> The posture's value is that every execution path inherits it,
/// and every path reaches tools through <see cref="ToolCallAdmissionPipeline"/> and nothing else. A
/// test that called the governor directly would prove the rule exists; driving the chain proves the
/// rule is reachable from where calls actually arrive. The per-path tests that prove each caller uses
/// the chain already exist and are not duplicated here — that property belongs to the chain, not to
/// this rule, and re-asserting it once per gate is how five copies of a sequence appeared in the first
/// place.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Approval routing is left off throughout,</strong> which is the shipped default: an approval
/// verdict with no router degrades to a block. That makes the assertions binary — the call was refused
/// or it was not — rather than depending on a simulated human.
