/// <para>
/// Two channels put tools in front of the model. Most arrive through <c>ToolChainBuilder</c>, which wraps
/// them for governance on the way past. The framework's own progressive-disclosure tools do not: they are
/// contributed by <see cref="AgentSkillsProvider"/>, exist only on the provider rail, and so this wrapper
/// is the only thing that can gate them.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A bundle run is the flow that makes the distinction matter. It executes an externally-authored agent
/// under a per-caller capability envelope naming the tools that caller may invoke, and enforcement is
/// armed by the envelope's presence rather than by the host's opt-in
/// (<see cref="GovernanceEnforcement.IsActive"/>). Before issue #347 the rail read the global switch
/// alone, so on a default composition <em>everything</em> on this channel was published unwrapped —
/// including <c>run_skill_script</c>, which executes a bundle author's script.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The line is not "wrap everything". An envelope grants domain tools, so a governed <c>load_skill</c> or
/// <c>read_skill_resource</c> would be refused for want of a grant no operator writes, and the bundle
/// would lose the instructions of the skills it shipped with — a failure that produces a working-looking
/// agent missing half its prompt. Those two are therefore exempt, using the same set
/// <see cref="ToolPermissionFilter"/> already exempts them by. <c>run_skill_script</c> is not.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The assertions here drive a real admission chain from a real tool invocation rather than checking
/// which wrapper type sits on the rail. A type assertion would still pass if the wrapper stopped
/// enforcing, which is the failure mode this assembly's <c>CLAUDE.md</c> records shipping repeatedly.
