/// times: a gate was added to one of the five execution paths and forgotten on the others, most
/// recently leaving a consumer's own safety rule live in a chat turn and absent from the identical
/// call issued from a plan. No unit test can fail for code that was never written, so the check has to
/// be over the source itself.
