/// that existed, looked correct, had thorough unit tests, and was never invoked, four separate
/// times: <c>ToolPermissionFilter</c>, <c>GoverningToolContextProvider</c>, both recall providers,
/// and <c>IAgentIdentityValidator</c> — whose <c>CanInvoke</c> was a complete fail-closed RBAC
/// implementation with fifteen passing tests and, until #311, no production caller at all. Three
/// doc comments meanwhile told readers it was enforcing.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Why unit tests cannot catch it.</strong> The control's own tests exercise the control
/// and pass. Nothing fails when the call that would reach it is simply never written. A test can
/// only fail for code that exists, so the check has to be over the source itself — the same
/// reasoning as <see cref="ToolCallAdmissionChokepointTests"/>, pointed the other way. That test
/// asserts nothing <em>but</em> the chain calls the gates; this one asserts something calls each
/// registered control at all.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>What this file does and does not cover.</strong> The consumer scan reads
/// <em>interfaces</em> declared under the guarded folders, so of the four defects named above it could
/// only ever have caught the last. The other three are concrete classes implementing no guarded
/// contract, and no exemption list can be curated into covering them without becoming the very smell
/// this test warns about. <see cref="NoFactoryDecidesAPerRunFactAtConstructionTime"/> covers the
/// second failure mode those three shared — a control wired correctly but decided at the wrong moment
/// — by reading source shape rather than contracts.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>What counts as a consumer.</strong> Any production file that names the interface and is
/// not its own declaration, not a type that implements it, and not a DI registration. That covers
