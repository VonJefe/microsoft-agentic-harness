/// Validates <see cref="ContentCaptureConfig"/>. All rules are conditional on
/// <see cref="ContentCaptureConfig.Enabled"/> — content-capture is OFF by
/// default and a disabled section imposes no constraints, so the template runs
/// out of the box. When enabled the rules ensure the redaction posture is
/// coherent: at least one category must be requested and every requested name
/// must map (case-insensitively) to a known
/// <see cref="RedactionCategory"/>. This mirrors the parsing behaviour of the
/// Infrastructure <c>ContentCapturePolicy</c>, so a config typo surfaces both
/// in the options-validation pipeline and (as a debug log) at runtime.
