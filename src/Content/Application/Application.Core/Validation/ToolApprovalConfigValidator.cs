/// value is that every approval-required tool call is refused for the life of the process, with
/// nothing to show for it but a per-call error log. That failure mode has already been found three
/// separate times on this config surface (a Quorum strategy with no threshold, a blank roster entry,
/// and an out-of-range timeout). Rejecting at boot converts a silent, permanent, hard-to-diagnose
/// outage into a startup error naming the setting.
