// Chat-client half of AgentFactory: everything between "which provider is this agent on" and "here is
// an IChatClient wrapped in the harness middleware". The two provider-specific construction paths
// (IChatClient providers and Foundry Responses), the resilient-client substitution, the middleware
// pipeline both paths share, and the two decisions that pipeline needs — whether sensitive content may
// reach telemetry, and what scope prerequisite completions are tracked against.
//
// These sit apart from the primary partial because none of them decide *what* agent to build: every
// member here is handed an already-resolved provider and options, and is concerned only with the
// transport underneath. That is the line: a member that resolves its own provider belongs next door.
//
// Deliberately a plain comment, not an XML doc: the type's <summary> lives on the primary partial in
// AgentFactory.cs. A second class-level <summary> on the same type would be merged into one <member>
// entry, and which one tooling shows is compile-order dependent.
