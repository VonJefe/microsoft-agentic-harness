// Context-provider half of AgentExecutionContextFactory: builds the AIContextProvider rail an agent
// runs on — progressive skill disclosure, the tool permission filter, cross-session and learnings
// recall, the governance wrapper, and the per-turn budget measurer.
//
// ORDER ON THIS RAIL IS BEHAVIOUR, NOT STYLE. The runtime feeds each provider the previous one's
// output, so a provider only sees what everything above it produced. Two positional rules hold the
// rail together, and each is stated once where it is enforced rather than restated here:
// tool contributors go above ToolPermissionFilter (see the inline comment at that call site), and the
// per-turn measurer goes last (see AppendPerTurnBudgetProvider). Moving a line here changes which
// tools an agent can call and what its budget records. AgentExecutionContextFactoryRailOrderTests
// asserts both by position rather than by presence, because every other test in this assembly reads
// the rail with OfType<T>().Single() and so passes whatever the order is.
//
// Deliberately a plain comment, not an XML doc: the type's <summary> lives on the primary partial in
// AgentExecutionContextFactory.cs. A second class-level <summary> on the same type would be merged
// into one <member> entry, and which one tooling shows is compile-order dependent.
