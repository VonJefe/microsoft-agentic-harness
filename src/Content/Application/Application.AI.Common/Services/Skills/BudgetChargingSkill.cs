/// <summary>
/// Wraps a framework skill so the tokens it puts into the model's context when the model pulls it on
/// demand are charged to <see cref="IContextBudgetTracker"/> — the Tier 2 body served by
/// <c>load_skill</c>, and the Tier 3 supporting files served by <c>read_skill_resource</c>.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Without this, those pulls happen entirely inside the framework's <see cref="AgentSkillsProvider"/>.
/// The harness records the static system prompt and the tool schemas at agent construction and then sees
/// nothing further, so a turn that loads several large skills mid-flight spends context the tracker still
/// believes is free. The budget then under-reports on precisely the turns most likely to exhaust it
/// (issue #248).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Why a wrapper and not a skills-source decorator.</b> The framework's source abstraction hands over
/// the skill <em>list</em>; the content pull happens later, per skill. Wrapping the source would give
/// exact accounting of nothing. This sits where the content actually flows. It also cannot be a subclass
/// of <see cref="AgentInlineSkill"/> — that type is sealed — so it derives from the <see cref="AgentSkill"/>
/// base and forwards every member.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Charged per pull, not per skill.</b> Each <c>load_skill</c> call appends its own tool-result message
/// to the conversation, so a skill loaded twice really does cost twice. Deduplicating would restore the
/// under-reporting this exists to remove.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>What "measured" means here.</b> The <em>content</em> is captured exactly — it passes through this
/// wrapper on its way to the model. The <em>token figure</em> is not exact: it comes from
/// <see cref="TokenEstimationHelper"/>, a characters-per-token approximation. That is deliberate, and it is
/// the same estimator the system prompt and tool schemas are charged with, so every component of the
/// budget is stated in one consistent unit. A tokenizer-accurate count for skills alone would make the
/// components incomparable, which is worse than a uniform approximation. What this fixes is a component
/// that was missing altogether, not the precision of the ones already there.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// This records consumption; it does not refuse it. <see cref="IContextBudgetTracker.EnsureBudget"/> is
/// deliberately not called here — turning an over-budget skill load into a thrown exception mid-turn is a
/// governance decision that belongs to whoever owns the turn, not to an accounting wrapper.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Instances are shared: the skill is held by a provider attached to an agent that is cached across turns
/// and may serve concurrent ones. All state here is the injected collaborators, and
/// <see cref="IContextBudgetTracker"/> is itself thread-safe.
