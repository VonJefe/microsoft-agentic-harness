/// active</em>, and that captured copy keeps seeing the overlay after the <see cref="Begin"/> scope
/// disposes on the originating flow. Concurrent runs on separate requests are unaffected (each request
/// is its own flow). The run driver must therefore not spawn detached work that should outlive — or be
/// isolated from — the ephemeral agent while the overlay is active; scope the overlay tightly around the
/// turn and let it fall out before any such work is queued.
