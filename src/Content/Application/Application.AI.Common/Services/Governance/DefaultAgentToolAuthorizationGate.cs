/// <strong>Where the executing identity comes from, and why it is not simply read off the
/// execution context.</strong> The context carries an identity only on the agent-turn path:
/// the resolution behaviour stamps it for <c>IAgentScopedRequest</c>, and the plan engine's
/// step executors and the Execution API's direct invoker each open a <em>fresh</em> DI scope,
/// whose context therefore starts blank. Reading the context alone would leave this gate
/// enforcing on one of the four execution paths the admission chain covers, and a control
/// that is skippable by issuing the same call from a plan step is not a control.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// So the gate falls back to resolving the identity itself. That is sound rather than a
/// workaround because <see cref="AgentIdentity"/> is a <em>workload</em> identity — the
/// Entra-bound principal of the running agent, obtained from managed identity, a federated
/// credential, or a certificate — not a per-request or per-user value. Resolving it from a
/// child scope yields the same principal the parent turn would have carried; the resolver is
/// a singleton for exactly that reason. The result is cached for this scope's lifetime so a
/// plan step issuing many tool calls pays at most one acquisition.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Every path out of an enabled gate that is not a positive allow is a denial.</strong>
/// No validator registered, no identity resolvable, a resolver failure — each is a case where
/// the harness cannot establish who is asking. Treating any of them as permissive would
/// reproduce the defect this type exists to close, and matches the standing rule that an
/// unestablished scope is never a safe default.
