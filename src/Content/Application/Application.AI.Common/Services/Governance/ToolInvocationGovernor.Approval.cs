// Human approval routing for the one verdict the governor cannot decide alone: a tool call that is
// neither plainly permitted nor plainly forbidden, and that policy says a person must rule on.
//
// Kept separate from the main governor file because it is the only decision path that leaves the
// process and waits on something outside it — everything in ToolInvocationGovernor.cs resolves from
// configuration and in-memory rules and returns immediately.
//
// NOTE: deliberately plain comments, not XML docs. Roslyn merges every partial's class-level
// <summary> into one <member> and publishes whichever file the compiler sees first — which is
// alphabetical, so this file would outrank ToolInvocationGovernor.cs and replace the type's real
// documentation with a note about one private method. No warning is emitted when that happens; it
// was caught here by reading the generated XML. Exactly one partial may carry the class-level doc,
// and it is the main file.
