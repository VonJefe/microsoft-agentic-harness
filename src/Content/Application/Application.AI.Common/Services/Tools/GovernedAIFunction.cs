/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Derives from <see cref="DelegatingAIFunction"/> so the wrapped function's name, description, and
/// JSON schema are preserved unchanged — only invocation is intercepted. On invoke it consults, in order:
/// the ambient <c>IToolInvocationGovernor</c> (via <see cref="ToolGovernanceAccessor"/>) — a denial
/// returns the governor's model-facing message in place of the tool result and the inner function is
/// never called; then the ambient <c>IToolClassificationGate</c> (via <see cref="ClassificationGateAccessor"/>)
/// — a block returns its model-facing message in place of the tool result, while a redact verdict lets the
/// call run and scrubs its output afterward; then the ambient <c>IToolCallObserverChain</c> (via
/// <see cref="ToolCallObserverAccessor"/>) — the host's own rules, whose block returns the generic
/// not-permitted message; and finally the ambient <c>IProgressEvaluator</c> (via
/// <see cref="ProgressGuardAccessor"/>) — a spin verdict returns its halt message in place of the tool
/// result. Each stage is evaluated only for calls the previous stages permitted, so a blocked call never
/// executed and must not count toward progress. When none are ambient (a tool invoked outside a governed
/// turn), the call passes straight through.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Consumer observers run last of the access gates, and that is deliberate.</strong> By the time
/// they are consulted every question about whether the agent may use the tool at all has been settled by
/// the built-in gates, so an observer can only make the outcome stricter — it cannot resurrect a call the
/// governor denied, overrule the capability envelope, or bypass a plugin's deny list.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>The progress guard runs after the observers, because it is the only stage that records
/// state.</strong> It is not an access decision — it is the turn's loop-detection accounting, and it must
/// only ever count calls that actually reached the tool. Placing it ahead of the observers let blocked
/// calls reset the no-progress counter, which defeated the guard for an agent spinning against an
/// observer's own rule.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// This is the single invocation-time chokepoint for the agent's autonomous tool calls, applied to
/// every converted tool regardless of source (keyed-DI, MCP, or skill-provided).
