/// <summary>
/// Formats a block of recalled memory for injection into an agent's instructions, wrapping the

/// part of its instructions is <em>data</em> rather than instruction.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Both recall providers — <see cref="KnowledgeMemoryContextProvider"/> and
/// <see cref="LearningsRecallContextProvider"/> — concatenate stored text into the instruction
/// channel, which is the most privileged region of the prompt. Trust classification at write time
/// decides <em>whether</em> remembered text is replayed; this decides <em>in what voice</em>. The two
/// are complementary: the write gate can only act on what a scanner recognises, so content that
/// passes it still must not arrive wearing the harness's own authority.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The shape follows the one already proven for untrusted judge input in
/// <c>JudgeCallCore.TryBuildPrompt</c>: a random per-invocation tag the recalled content cannot have
/// been written to anticipate, a directive naming that exact tag, and a refusal — rather than a
/// guess — if the content turns out to contain the tag anyway.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>It is a sibling of that code, not a candidate to be merged with it, and the difference is
/// the interesting part.</strong> The judge HTML-encodes every value it envelopes
/// (<c>PromptTemplateRenderer</c>), so an injected angle bracket cannot reconstruct a closing tag at
/// all and its nonce is a second layer behind that encoding. Recalled memory is <em>not</em> encoded
/// — encoding it would corrupt the very text the agent is meant to read — so here the nonce is the
/// only layer. That is why this collision check is case-insensitive and the judge's is not, and why
/// this one fails closed rather than continuing: the same defence carrying different weight in the
/// two places. Unifying them would have to erase that difference or parameterise it, and a shared
/// helper whose behaviour is entirely determined by a flag is two implementations wearing one name.
