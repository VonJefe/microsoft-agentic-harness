/// <summary>
/// An <see cref="AIContextProvider"/> that closes the <see cref="AIContext"/> tool channel: it drops
/// tools colliding with a reserved plan-capability name and wraps the rest in a
/// <see cref="GovernedAIFunction"/> at invocation time, so both checks run even for tools that never
/// pass through <see cref="ToolChainBuilder"/> — notably framework tools surfaced by progressive skill
/// disclosure, and any tool a consumer's own <see cref="AIContextProvider"/> contributes.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Register this provider <em>last</em> in the <c>AIContextProviders</c> list (after the skills
/// provider and <see cref="ToolPermissionFilter"/>) so it sees the final, filtered tool set.
/// Already-wrapped functions and non-function tools pass through unchanged, so it composes safely
/// with the build-time wrapping in <see cref="ToolChainBuilder"/> (no double-wrapping).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Two channels, one filter.</strong> The framework merges <c>ChatOptions.Tools</c> (built by
/// <see cref="ToolChainBuilder"/>) with <c>AIContext.Tools</c> contributed by providers. Only the first
/// passes through the builder, so the reserved plan-capability check is applied here through the shared
/// <see cref="ReservedPlanCapabilityFilter"/> rather than being duplicated — a name the plan engine owns
/// cannot reach the model down either route, and the two enforcement points cannot drift.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The governance wrapper is inert unless an admission chain is ambient for the turn (see
/// <see cref="Governance.ToolAdmissionAccessor"/>), so wrapping only adds enforcement. The reserved-name
/// drop is the one case where this provider changes which tools exist, and only for names that must never
/// have been publishable in the first place.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>That inertness is what licenses attaching this provider unconditionally, and it must stay
/// unconditional (issue #347).</strong> The rail is assembled once, when the agent is constructed, and
/// agents are cached — but a bundle run arms enforcement afterwards and per run, by publishing a
/// capability envelope (see <see cref="Governance.GovernanceEnforcement.IsActive"/>). A guard at
/// construction therefore cannot see the flow that most needs governing: the earlier one read the host's
/// global switch alone, and on the default composition a bundle's progressive-disclosure tools — two of
/// which are exempt from <see cref="ToolPermissionFilter"/> by design, leaving this their only gate —
/// reached the model unwrapped. Re-adding any condition here reopens that hole for a saving of one list
/// entry on an ungoverned host.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>This provider overrides <see cref="AIContextProvider.InvokingCoreAsync"/>, not
/// <c>ProvideAIContextAsync</c>, and that choice is load-bearing.</b> <c>ProvideAIContextAsync</c> is
/// contractually an <em>additive</em> hook: the base implementation merges whatever it returns into the
/// incoming context as <c>Tools = input.Concat(provided)</c>. Implemented there, this provider was inert
/// in both of its jobs — every reserved name it dropped was restored from the input, and every tool it
/// wrapped was published <em>alongside</em> its own unwrapped original, leaving the model an ungoverned
/// copy to call. Only overriding the merge can remove or replace a tool. Any future refactor that moves
/// this logic back onto <c>ProvideAIContextAsync</c> silently disables a security control, so
/// <c>AIContextProviderMergeContractTests</c> drives every provider in this assembly through the public
/// <see cref="AIContextProvider.InvokingAsync"/> entry point the runtime actually uses.
