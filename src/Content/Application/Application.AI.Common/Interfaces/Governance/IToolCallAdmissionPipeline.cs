/// <strong>Why this exists.</strong> A tool call can reach a tool through five different execution
/// paths — the agent turn, the Execution API, and the plan engine's tool, LLM and retrieval steps.
/// Each one used to ask the same admission questions by hand, in its own copy of the sequence,
/// obtaining the gates three different ways. A gate was added to one path and forgotten on the others
/// four separate times; the last of those left a consumer's own safety rule live in a chat turn and
/// absent from the identical call issued from a plan. Adding a gate here adds it to every path at
/// once, so there is no longer a set of other paths to forget.
/// </para>

/// <strong>The order is the safety argument, not an implementation detail.</strong>

/// <see cref="IAgentToolAuthorizationGate"/> — whether the executing agent's workload identity is
/// permitted this tool at all. First because it is the most fundamental access question and the
/// cheapest to answer, and because the next stage can escalate to a human: asking a person to
/// approve a call that RBAC refuses anyway is a wasted interruption that also teaches operators to
/// approve calls which were never permitted.
