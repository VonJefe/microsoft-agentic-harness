/// <summary>
/// Resolves the effective tool allowlist for an agent by applying its declared tool <em>ceiling</em>
/// to the allowlist its skills already grant. This is the single, security-critical primitive behind
/// the agent tool ceiling: a ceiling can only ever <em>tighten</em> the set of tools an agent may
/// invoke — it can never widen it.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// An agent's <c>allowed-tools</c> frontmatter is a request for an upper bound, not a grant. The tools
/// an agent can actually use are the ones its skills contribute; the ceiling can remove tools from that
/// set but never add one the skills did not already permit. This mirrors how a bundle's self-declared
/// capabilities are only <em>requests</em> against a host-granted envelope — the same tighten-only
/// posture applied one level down, at the agent/skill boundary.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A bare <c>IReadOnlyList&lt;string&gt;</c> cannot distinguish "no restriction at all" from "a
/// restriction that happens to permit nothing", and conflating the two is a privilege-escalation bug:
/// once an intersection has narrowed to nothing, a later ceiling must NOT be able to re-grant tools.
/// So this primitive uses <see langword="null"/> for <em>unbounded</em> (no restriction) and a non-null
/// list — <em>including an empty one</em> — for <em>bounded</em> (empty = deny all). With that
/// distinction the operation is a monotone intersection that is always safe to chain: applying more
/// ceilings can only ever shrink the set.
