/// <strong>What this changes.</strong> When the tool governor resolves a call to "requires approval"
/// it has always recorded <c>PendingApproval</c> and blocked — nobody was ever asked. With this
/// enabled the governor instead raises an escalation naming the tool and its arguments, waits for a
/// human decision, and lets the call proceed only if it is approved. A denial, a timeout, or any
/// failure to reach a decision still blocks, so the change can only ever turn a block into an
/// approved call — never the reverse.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Off by default, and doubly gated.</strong> Routing requires both this
/// <see cref="Enabled"/> flag and <see cref="EscalationConfig.Enabled"/>. With either off the
/// governor's behaviour is exactly as before (block, fail-closed), so existing deployments are
/// unchanged until an operator opts in and names a roster.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>This blocks the agent's turn.</strong> The tool call is suspended while a human decides,
/// which is the point — an advisory observer cannot stop an action that has already happened. The
/// cost is real latency in the turn, bounded by <see cref="TimeoutSeconds"/>. Hosts on a latency
/// budget (a real-time voice agent, for instance) should keep the timeout short and accept the
/// timeout action as the answer rather than disabling the gate.

    /// A synchronous HTTP call is a poor place to wait on a human at all, so the recommended posture
    /// for hosts that expose direct invocation is either to keep this well under

    /// approval routing for the agent path and let the Execution API's capability envelope do the

    /// whole DAG rather than one step — including steps that needed no approval at all. Hosts running
    /// plans unattended should either keep this timeout short, or express the checkpoint as an
    /// explicit <c>HumanGate</c> step — the plan-native way to wait on a person, which queues its
