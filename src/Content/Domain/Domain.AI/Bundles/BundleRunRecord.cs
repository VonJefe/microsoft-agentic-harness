/// <summary>
/// The in-memory, TTL'd record of one bundle run — the async job created when a caller invokes a staged
/// bundle. It carries both the run's <em>inputs</em> (the handle it targets, the resolved capability
/// envelope, and the conversation request) and its evolving <em>state</em> (status, outcome, timestamps),
/// so the background dispatcher can pick a run up by id alone, re-arm the ambient envelope on its detached
/// thread, and drive it to completion.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The host is not the system of record for bundle runs: records live only in memory and are evicted by
/// TTL. A record is created <see cref="BundleRunStatus.Queued"/>, transitions once to
/// <see cref="BundleRunStatus.Running"/> when the dispatcher picks it up, and once more to a terminal
/// <see cref="BundleRunStatus.Succeeded"/>/<see cref="BundleRunStatus.Failed"/>. It is immutable; each
/// transition is a <c>with</c>-copy the store swaps in.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Why the envelope rides on the record.</strong> The background dispatcher runs on a thread pool
/// flow detached from the request that enqueued the run, so the ambient <c>CapabilityEnvelope</c> published
/// during the HTTP request does not flow to it. The resolved grant is therefore captured here at enqueue
/// time and re-published by the dispatcher (<c>CapabilityEnvelopeAccessor.Begin</c>) for the duration of the
/// run — without it the governor would see no envelope and fail open. The staged bundle backing
/// <see cref="Handle"/> supplies the ephemeral-agent overlay the same way (looked up by handle at dispatch),
/// so the overlay is not duplicated here.
