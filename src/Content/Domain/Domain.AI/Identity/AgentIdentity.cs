/// <summary>
/// The workload identity of a running agent. Carried on the agent-execution scope

/// API call can be attributed to a specific Entra-bound agent principal.

/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <see cref="AgentIdentity"/> is the durable RBAC boundary for outbound work. Prompt-level
/// rules degrade under adversarial input; the agent's runtime identity (and the Azure RBAC
/// it carries) does not. Tool-level RBAC reads this identity at every call site and validates
/// against the tool's allowlist.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Separate from the human-caller scope (<c>KnowledgeScopeAccessor</c>). The human-caller
/// scope answers "who initiated this work and which tenant's data are we touching?";
/// <see cref="AgentIdentity"/> answers "which agent is currently running on behalf of that
/// human?". Both flow through tool calls; RBAC checks are independent and ANDed.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Records throughout the harness validate at boundaries (Application-layer FluentValidation),
/// not in constructors. This record accepts any non-null <see cref="Id"/> and any
/// <see cref="AgentIdentityKind"/>; <c>IAgentIdentityValidator</c> enforces the
/// real invariants (no <see cref="AgentIdentityKind.Unspecified"/>, kind-specific required
/// fields, etc.) when it is consulted.

/// It is consulted on the live tool path through <c>IAgentToolAuthorizationGate</c>, stage 1 of
/// the tool-call admission chain, and only while
/// <c>AppConfig.AI.Identity.ToolAuthorization.Enabled</c> is set — the feature is opt-in, and with
/// it off no invariant on this record is enforced at all. Treat an <see cref="AgentIdentity"/>
/// obtained from anywhere as unvalidated data until that gate has passed it.
