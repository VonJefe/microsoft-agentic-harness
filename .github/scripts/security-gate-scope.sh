# Decides whether the security reviewer must run for a diff, and what it should look at.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
# --------------------
# The gate used to select purely by FOLDER NAME (/Auth/, /Identity/, /Security/,
# /Migrations/, .github/, infra/). That filter skipped six consecutive PRs — #203,
# #205, #207, #208, #209, #210 — every one of which changed authorization,
# multi-tenant scoping, or capability-envelope code. It has also been observed
# missing two HIGH findings in a single day. A gate that does not fire on the
# changes it exists to review is not a gate.
#
# Folder names describe where code lives, not what it does. This repo keeps its
# security-critical logic in Controllers/, Runs/, Planner/ and Interfaces/ — so the
# decision is made on what the diff SAYS, with the old path list kept as a
# supplement (a migration or a workflow file is worth reviewing whatever it says).
#
# SINGLE AUTHORITY
# ----------------
# Both callers — .github/workflows/security-review.yml (remote, blocking) and
# scripts/rails/run-gates.sh (local pre-flight) — call this script. They previously
# carried duplicate copies of the regex under a "keep in sync" comment, which is the
# drift trap this repo has closed elsewhere (ApproverClaimTypes, EscalationStepOutput,
# ConditionExpressionRules). One definition, two readers.
#
# USAGE
#   security-gate-scope.sh --base <ref> [--head <ref>] [--format github|human]
#
# `--head` defaults to HEAD. It exists so the decision can be replayed against any
# historical commit without checking it out — which is how the test harness proves
# the gate fires on the PRs it used to miss.
#
# OUTPUT (key=value lines; `github` format also appends them to $GITHUB_OUTPUT)
#   required=true|false   whether the reviewer must run
#   trigger=path|content|path+content|none
#   reason=<one line, human-readable>
#   signals=<comma-separated markers matched; empty only when nothing matched>
#
# The two signals are additive: a diff can trigger on both, and the scope file is
# then the UNION. Never make one branch suppress the other — see the comment on the
# TRIGGER block for the hole that created.
#
# The matched files are written to the path given by SECURITY_SCOPE_FILE when set,
# so the caller can point the reviewer at them instead of the whole diff.
#
# EXIT CODES
#   0  decision made (read `required`)
#   2  usage error or the diff could not be computed — callers must FAIL CLOSED.

# Signal 1 — paths that are worth reviewing whatever their contents say.
# Every segment is slash-anchored so it matches a whole directory component.
# Keep in sync with .github/CODEOWNERS.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# `scripts/rails/` is here because those scripts ARE the gates — a change to
# run-gates.sh is a change to what gets reviewed, exactly like a change to
# .github/. Additions only; everything from the original list is preserved
# verbatim, so this trigger can only widen, never narrow.
#
# `.claude/hooks/` is the same argument one directory over, and it was missed.
# PR #226 rewrote the push gate — review-gate.ps1, review-scope.ps1,
# save-review-receipt.ps1 and both of their test suites, five files that decide
# whether ANY review happens at all — and raised no path signal, because the list
# named the rails but not the hooks. A change to the thing that decides what gets
# reviewed is the change most worth reviewing.
#
# `.claude/settings.json` is listed with them because it is where the hooks are WIRED.
# Gating the hook scripts while leaving their registration ungated protects the lock
# and not the door: deleting the PreToolUse entry disables the push gate completely
# without touching a single gated file. `.json` is excluded from the CONTENT scan by
# design (package-lock churn), so only this path entry can catch it.
#
# `settings.local.json` is matched too, and deliberately has NO test pinning it: it is
# gitignored, so it can never appear in a diff and a synthetic case cannot stage one.
# That unreachability is exactly why the alternative is here rather than omitted — the
# day someone un-ignores it, the gate should already cover it instead of discovering
# the hole the way it discovered this one.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Signal 2 — security-relevant code, by what the changed lines actually contain.
#
# Grouped by the risk each marker stands for. Markers are deliberately specific:
# a bare `Token` would match every CancellationToken in the codebase and fire on
# everything, which degrades to the same uselessness as never firing at all.
#
# THE LIST IS A VOCABULARY, AND A MISSING WORD IS A MISSING GATE.
# The first five groups describe authorization, scope isolation, capability,
# credentials, and reachable surface. They say nothing about the filesystem — so
# PR #215, which was *entirely* path confinement (canonicalisation, per-segment
# symlink resolution, a root-prefix comparison, a confinement latch), raised zero
# signals and the reviewer was skipped. It reported `pass` in five seconds. The
# code had been reviewed only because a human ran the reviewer by hand.
#
# That is the same failure as the folder-only filter above, one category over: the
# gate did not fire on the changes it exists to review. The last two groups close
# the two categories this repo actually has code in — filesystem confinement, and
# code execution / unsafe deserialization.
#
# COUNTS ARE PER TRACKED FILE, NOT PER GREP HIT. Measure with `git ls-files`, never
# a bare recursive grep: bin/ and obj/ inflate some markers more than tenfold (AntiSSRF
# reads as 1101 hits and 28 tracked files), and build artifacts can never appear in a
# diff. A marker judged on the inflated number gets rejected for noise it cannot cause.
#
# DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED, so nobody "completes" the list later and breaks it:
#   HttpClient (101 of 3,208 tracked .cs files) and JsonSerializer.Deserialize (57)
#   are real SSRF and deserialization signals in the abstract, and useless here — they
#   appear in nearly every connector and DTO, so adding them makes the gate fire on
#   every PR. A gate that always fires is triaged as noise and is worth no more than
#   one that never fires.
#
#   SSRF is therefore covered by naming the GUARD rather than the mechanism:
#   EgressPolicy / EgressAllowlist / AntiSSRF / Ssrf. A PR that weakens or bypasses
#   egress policy is the SSRF change actually worth reviewing, and those types appear
#   only in code that is about egress control — so the signal stays specific while
#   every ordinary outbound call stays silent. Both halves are pinned by tests:
#   touching the policy fires, holding an HttpClient does not.
#
#   ChatMessage (105 tracked .cs files, the same basis as the 101 above) is excluded for
#   the same reason as HttpClient: it is ordinary agent plumbing present in nearly every
#   conversation path. AIContext is in, at 27. The two words look equally
#   security-adjacent and differ four-fold in how often they appear, which is the whole
#   argument for counting rather than reasoning category-by-category. Count before adding.
#
# THE GAP THAT ADDED THE LAST TWO GROUPS
# --------------------------------------
# PR #227 moved GoverningToolContextProvider off AIContextProvider's ADDITIVE
# ProvideAIContextAsync hook onto InvokingCoreAsync. Implemented on the additive hook
# the provider was inert: the base merge restores everything it dropped and publishes
# an unwrapped copy of everything it wrapped. A tool-permission control that reads as
# enforcing was enforcing nothing: a security control dead in production. This gate
# scored the PR that fixed it required=false, trigger=none, signals=(none).
# Replayed against the isolated fix commit alone it still scored zero, so it was not
# dilution by a large diff; the vocabulary simply had no word for the agent-context
# surface. CLAUDE.md records this same defect landing four separate times.
#
# The gate is now on its third widening of exactly this shape — folder-only missed
# #203-#210, the content list missed #215's path confinement, and it missed #227's
# agent context. Each time the fix was a category the list had no word for, so the two
# groups below name this repo's remaining AI-security surfaces rather than only the one
# that just bit: ambient scope propagation (AsyncLocal is how knowledge scope reaches
# child scopes and post-turn background writes), the sanctioned identity resolver
# (GetUserIdOrNull — CLAUDE.md forbids a second precedence ladder, so a change here is
# the scope-isolation defect class), approval bypass, and content-safety.

# THE FIFTH MISS — conversation ownership had no word at all.
# PR #239 made the conversation store SQLite-backed and default: required=false,
# trigger=none, signals=(none), skipped in 7 seconds. PR #240 then moved the
# ownership check INTO that store, making it the single enforcement point for
# "is this conversation yours?" — and it fired only on AsyncLocal, ClaimsPrincipal
# and OwnerId, i.e. on incidental plumbing, not on the authorization change. A pass
# earned by coincidence is not coverage; replay both before touching this group.
#
# `callerId` is the marker rather than `UserId`, and the difference is measured, not
# reasoned: UserId is 95 of 3,249 tracked .cs files — the same band as the
# permanently-excluded ChatMessage (105) and HttpClient (101) — because it labels
# every DTO, log line and telemetry record in the repo. `callerId` is 50, and appears
# only where caller identity is THREADED, which is exactly the authorization surface.
# It also catches a check being deleted: removing an argument puts callerId on a `-`
# line, and the scan reads removed lines too.
#
# The other three name the enforcement machinery, per the #227 lesson that a control
# can be rewritten, moved, or disabled without any line of the diff mentioning what it
# protects: ConversationOwnership (the shared rules), ConversationAccessDenied (the
# refusal), IConversationStore (26 files — the interface that now owes the guarantee;
# CLAUDE.md forbids re-implementing the check at a call site).
#
# Noise cost is measured across the last 25 merges: exactly ONE newly fires — #239,
# the one it wrongly skipped. Zero collateral on the other 24.
